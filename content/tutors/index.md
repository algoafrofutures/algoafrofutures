Antonio Roberts is an artist and curator based in Birmingham, UK, working primarily with video, code, and sound. He is critically engaged with the themes surrounding network culture and in his practice explores how technology continues to shape ideas of creation, ownership, and authorship. As a performing visual artist and musician he utilises live coding techniques to demystify technology and reveal its design decisions, limitations, and creative potential.

## Gary Stewart

Gary Stewart (b.1961.Birmingham, UK) is an interdisciplinary artist working at the intersection of sound, moving image and computational creativity. For several decades he has been involved in pioneering initiatives and projects around the world that explore and examine social and political issues of identity, culture, technology and creativity. Through the application of innovative technologies and practices based on informal, networked, peer-led shared learning he is part of a growing global network of collaborators who are advocates for equality, climate justice and better health through the arts particularly those from marginalised communities. Operating through a range of theoretical, fictional and artistic frames his work interrogates how we might establish meaningful connections with disenfranchised groups in society and to provide ways for them to construct their own spaces of memory so that their voices can be heard.

He is a founder member of London based artist, research and performance group Dubmorphology and Part Time Lecturer in Fine Art (Studio Practice) at Goldsmiths, University of London.
