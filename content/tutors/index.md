(Afro|Algo)futures is being run as part of the AHRC funded research project, Music and the Internet: Towards a Digital Sociology of Music. DIGSOCMUS is an interdisciplinary research project that aims to provide the first comprehensive analysis of the changing cultural roles of the internet in electronic music. The project takes as its historical focus a twenty-year period ranging from the early take up of the world wide web to the present day world of social media platforms, and aims to understand the extent to which uses of the internet have affected or contributed to
1. greater boundary crossing between 'art' and 'popular' musics;
2. an expansion or diversification of contemporary genres in terms of their geographical reach or representation; and
3. transformations in the institutions that provide for the production and distribution of music.

## FoAM Kernow


(Afro|Algo)futures is co-organised with FoAM Kernow, a non-profit company working towards a world with equitable access to knowledge, where thoughtful tools and interventions help us play with complexity and make better decisions, and environmental and social issues are centred and addressed with urgency.
