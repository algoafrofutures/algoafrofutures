## FAQ

### What can I expect to be doing as part of this programme?
The main contact through the programme will be five workshop sessions of at least three hours each. The workshops will take place at in Vivid Projects in Birmingham.

In addition we expect participants to spend additional time outside the workshop sessions, with the opportunity for one-to-one mentoring with the tutors, and to perform live at an event at the end of the project. Overall we will look for a time commitment equivalent to at least five days' work spread over the five weeks of the project, but you are of course free invest to much more of your time.

We will provide a clear structure for the programme, however this is also an opportunity for you to do something new, so will be happy to look at changing the shape of the programme to fit your goals and artistic outcomes.

We anticipate really varied levels of experience, there's no need to have any experience with computer programming or making music or art. We'll introduce you to all that, get you up to speed and support you in taking it further/integrating with your existing artistic practice.

### What will I need to take part?

You will need a laptop running either Windows (version 10 or later), MacOS (Catalina or above) or Linux.

We will be installing software, which will require you to have full administrator privileges on your computer.

Chromebooks, iPads, tablets and phones are unfortunately not suitable.

### Can you provide laptops or equipment?
Unfortunately we do not have the resources to provide laptops.

### When is the closing date for applications?
The call is open from Thursday 14th April to Tuesday 3rd May 17:00 BST. Applications submitted after this date will not be considered.

### How does the selection process work?
All applications will first be checked to make sure that they're eligible. Those that are will be reviewed by the programme team first individually, and then as a group.

We will then contact successful applicants. At any of these stages we may contact applicants to ask for clarifications or further information.

### How many people will be chosen?
Up to ten.

### Can I apply as a collective?
While we recognise that many artists and musicians work in groups, the focus of this programme is on the development of individuals, so unfortunately collectives/groups cannot apply.

### How do you define early career artists?
For this question we borrow from [Jerwood Arts's defintion](https://jerwoodarts.org/faq/):

> We think of those in the early stages of their careers as usually within the first 10 years of establishing their practice. Broadly speaking, this means the artist/curator/producer will have had some professional experience and reached a critical moment in their career, and will require a particular kind of support in order to maximise their potential and propel them into the next phase of their development.

> For [this programme] it means that, unless an individual has had a career change or break, their first professional experience will have been between 2011 and 2021.

### Why can only Black people apply?
Live coding is a developing practice that is in need of diverse perspectives in order to move forward in a creative and healthy way. There have long been efforts in this direction but with some exceptions, these have largely focussed on gender diversity, countering the heavy male bias in technology, with some success. These efforts have been intersectional but the recent growth of the Black Lives Matter movement during 2020 has caused us to reflect further on the disproportionate lack of Black artists in the UK live coding scene. This is despite much of live coded music heavily inspired by Black music, much of which developed against a political struggle.

Although this project responds to the lack of Black representation in the live coding and Algorave scene we don’t necessarily intend to 'solve' that problem. Instead we want to provide early career artists with the time and resources to explore live coding and algorithmic music/art, and take it in whatever directions they want to (or not!). In the process we can learn about what barriers and opportunities there are for those futures.

### How do you define "Black"?
For this question we borrow the definition of Black from the [Black Ticket Project](https://royalcourttheatre.com/black-ticket-project/):

> BTP define 'Black' as of Black African, Caribbean, Afro-Latinx and African-American heritage, including those of mixed-Black heritage who identify as such.

### Why can only people from the West Midlands apply?
This is a pilot project that we would like to expand in the future, but for now we are interested in creating the opportunity for a local live coding community of practice to grow in the West Midlands area.

### Do you provide expenses?
Each projecft participant is supported by a £500 bursary which covers participation in five workshops and a final event. This bursary is expected to cover travel costs.

### When are we given the bursary?
Participants will be given their bursary two installments, at the beginnig of the programme and towards the end of the programme

### How is the project funded?
(Algo|Afro) Futures is funded by Birimingham City Council as a Creative City project, part of Birmingham 2022.
