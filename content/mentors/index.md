# Mentors

## Antonio Roberts

<img style="width:100%" src="/antonio-roberts.jpg" />

Antonio Roberts is an artist and curator based in Birmingham, UK, working primarily with video, code, and sound. He is critically engaged with the themes surrounding network culture and in his practice explores how technology continues to shape ideas of creation, ownership, and authorship. As a performing visual artist and musician he utilises live coding techniques to demystify technology and reveal its design decisions, limitations, and creative potential.

## Gary Stewart

Gary Stewart is an artist working at the intersection of sound, moving image and computational creativity. His work examines social and political issues of identity, culture, and technology. Through the application of innovative technologies and practices based on networked, peer-led shared learning he is part of a network of collaborators who are advocates for equality, climate justice and better health through the arts especially those from marginalised communities. Operating through a range of theoretical, fictional, and artistic frames his work looks at how we might establish meaningful connections with disenfranchised groups in society which provide a way for them to construct their own spaces of memory so that their voices can be heard.

He is a founder member of London based artist, research, and performance group Dubmorphology and Part-Time Lecturer in Fine Art at Goldsmiths, University of London.
