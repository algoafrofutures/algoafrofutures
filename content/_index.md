## (Afro|Algo)futures

#### (Afro|Algo)futures is a mentoring programme for early career Black performing artists who want to explore the creative potential of live coding.

#### Live coding is a performative practice where artists and musicians use code to create live music and live visuals. This is often done at electronic dance music events called Algoraves, but live coding is a technique rather than a genre, and has also been applied to noise music, choreography, live cinema, and many other time-based artforms.

Since its inception in 2014 there have been hundreds of Algoraves taking place in over 100 cities and festivals around the world, including performances at Glastonbury, Sonar, SXSW, Bluedot, Mutek and Transmediale. There have been many events in Birmingham including audio/visual focussed parties at Vivid projects in Digbeth.

## About the programme

Over the 5/6 week programme you will participate in a mix of in-person workshops and asynchronous online discussion around live coding. The tutors will be Antonio Roberts and Alex McLean, two leading artists within live coding. More information about them and other partners can be read on the [Tutors](/tutors) page.

This opportunity is open for West Midlands-based artists only. A participation fee will be offered and travel expenses within the West Midlands will be covered.

## Applicant profile

We are looking for applications from early career artists developing work within performing arts practices (music, choreography, live/performance art, etc), and prior experience in coding is not required - only a curiosity to learn! Live coding is surprisingly accessible, and as an algorithmic artform has more in common with weaving, cooking and knitting than software engineering. We are interested in supporting people in taking it in new directions.

## Key information

(Afro|Algo) Futures will take place between April - June at Vivid Projects. Dates will be confirmed in response to lockdown restrictions and participant availability.

The call is open now until 23:59 on 28th February GMT. Applications submitted after this date will not be considered.

Four successful applicants will be chosen to take part.

Each participant will be given a fee of Â£200 per workshop, plus reasonable travel expenses.
